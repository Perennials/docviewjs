	Add the states from HtmlArea > .label to .Label and remove them from HtmlArea

without solution so far:

	There should be a way to declare new view type, for example SourceView, which will inherit another type, for example Panel,
	and all the subviews should be able to come from templat. The problem is 1) SourceView.extend( Panel ) is hardcoded 2)
	if this SourceView should have for example layout or other attribute it can not be specified in template but must be hardcoded
	beucase the template will look like <Template><Child1/><Child2/></Template>. For 2) it is possible to introduce some method
	which will pass attributes of <Template> to the constructor but this is not perfect. For 1) I have no solution.
	
	Make View's bound data GC-able. But how to know it won't be used anymore?

	In the testsuite the tootip for the "Label" in not shown in IE. This is because of the order in which XML attributes are iterated which is different in IE. Since the argument order can not be relied upon other solution is needed.

	Would be nice if EventHandler's callback receives reference to the EventHandler somehow.

style:

	Style: Improve error handling, things expected to work should throw rather than returing bool or null (like View.addView()) (search for 
	return null or return false)

	Style: Use .defineStatic for all static stuff
	
	Revise OOP. Get rid of extends and use only mixins and interfaces. mixins should keep track of what is mixed in the object and .instanceof()
	should check it if the real instanceof fails.

future:

	View.addView( view, 'after'|'before', otherView )
	View.addView( view, 'after#otherviewid'|'before#otherviewid' )
	
	Custom scrolling ( hidden scrollbars, shown only while scrolling over the content, mac like )
	
	Checkbox, radio, Input(+multiline,+password), Overlay, Popup, Dialog (+in separate window), Tooltip, Dropdown list,
	Virtual scroller, Date picker, Grid, Slider, Spinner (input with arrows up and down to change numbers), Menu,
	Autocomplete, Progress bar, Tree
